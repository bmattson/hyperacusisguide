      <h1>Hyperacusis</h1>

      <p>
        Hyperacusis is a condition characterized by an abnormally heightened
        sensitivity to everyday sounds that are typically well tolerated by others.
        People with hyperacusis may perceive normal environmental noises—such as
        running water, clinking dishes, or voices—as uncomfortably loud or
        intrusive. This reaction does not stem from hearing loss but from a
        dysregulation within the auditory system, where sound processing pathways
        become overly reactive. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The condition often follows acoustic trauma,
        prolonged noise exposure, otologic injury, or neurological dysfunction,
        and it can vary widely in severity. For many individuals, hyperacusis
        causes distress, anxiety, and social withdrawal as they attempt to avoid
        environments that provoke discomfort. Proper management focuses on
        protecting against harmful sound exposure while gradually reintroducing
        tolerable sounds in a controlled, stable environment to help restore
        auditory tolerance.
      </p>

      <h1>Noxacusis</h1>
      <p>
        Noxacusis is a severe, pain-associated form of hyperacusis in which
        certain sounds not only feel intolerably loud but also produce physical
        pain in the ears or surrounding areas. This pain may manifest as burning,
        stabbing, or pressure sensations, and it can persist or worsen after sound
        exposure—a phenomenon known as delayed ear pain. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Noxacusis is believed to
        involve damage or sensitization of the cochlear nerve fibers and
        pain-transmitting pathways, leading to a maladaptive pain response to
        normal sound levels. Even moderate noises such as conversation, traffic,
        or running appliances can provoke intense discomfort, making daily
        functioning extremely difficult. Because noxacusis can rapidly progress
        and lead to debilitating sound intolerance, early recognition and strict
        noise control are critical. Creating a safe, predictable sound environment
        can prevent further injury and allow gradual stabilization of symptoms
        over time.
      </p>

      <h1>Tinnitus</h1>
      <p>
        Tinnitus is the perception of sound—often described as ringing, buzzing,
        hissing, or humming—in the absence of an external source. It arises from
        abnormal activity within the auditory system, typically following noise
        exposure, otologic injury, or neural dysfunction. 
      </p>
      <p>While tinnitus and
        hyperacusis are distinct conditions, they frequently occur together and
        may share underlying mechanisms such as increased central auditory gain,
        neural hyperactivity, or damage to cochlear nerve fibers. In many
        patients, the presence of tinnitus reflects maladaptive changes in how
        the brain interprets reduced or distorted auditory input, similar to how
        hyperacusis represents an over-amplified response to external sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The combination of tinnitus and hyperacusis can be particularly
        distressing—one producing internal noise and the other heightening
        external sound perception—leading to anxiety, sleep disturbance, and
        reduced quality of life. Stabilizing the auditory environment, avoiding
        further acoustic trauma, and supporting the nervous system’s recovery
        are key components in managing both conditions.
